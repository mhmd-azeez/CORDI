What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this?
Do you remember the flowers?
My job is to help.

God bless you.
Over the eyes.
Come and get the gas.
It's the way you thought it would be.
Talk together
Eddie, do you want to quit or not?
On the other hand, they're children.
You shout, how can I say it?
A weak woman must be weak. A man must be angry.
Don't be afraid. I'm not going to the city tonight.
The blind man searches for him. What do you have to do?
Everybody comes in, that's my list. Give it up.

The blind come and they don't eat. They don't stop for a while.
Do not weep. God is great.
How many numbers do you have?
I've had them bleed twice a day.
I'm an orphan, and I'm asking you not to do anything good.
They looked up to him when he came back.
There are some policies that don't make you angry.
