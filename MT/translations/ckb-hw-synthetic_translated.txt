People who wear Kurdish suits
It's coming from the south.
Don't go!
No one likes this kind of law.
Yeah? If it were me.
They'll take it and give us permission.
He's got a cold.
He's got a cold.
My eyes have seen Ango badly.
Yes, we have two 9s of gasoline.

Yeah, that's all right.
The oppressed, the poor and the poor.
Lo is this thing.
I'm going out. I'm not going to say what I want to say.
I bought 6,000 things from you.
No one is going to bring the atom to the altar.
He brought it to her at midnight.
You don't understand, you're blind.
I'm just going to sit down.
That's what people are going to make fun of.
I don't know the answer to that question.
They don't say the world's on your back.
You're not going back to work.
It's a strange dream.
Come here, come here, I know it's now.
Countries that have police officers have a lot of police.
I'm not a city councilman.
Well, you've never seen a sheep.
But I'm not talking to him.
I'm going to take it all off. I'm not going to live under that name.
I'm looking at what he's doing.
He was right. Did Isa come to the mosque?
It's not that hard to get gasoline.
Maybe they won't say no.
That's one of the things that's gonna make you feel better about the law.
Say that whenever you scream.
This is the old man, this is the old man, this is the old man.
This is the old man, this is the old man, this is the old man.
You'll be back in six months.
You know where you're going?
I'm not saying anything but they're lying.
What's he doing here, do it to the nurse.
Here's where we're going.
You can talk about the Kurdish national products.
This is Ango I'm upset.
We have twin deaths.
Don't look at this! My dad, I'm a cop.
"Lord, give me your ear, and he will hear you".
Can you bring this deaf man out of the ears of the dead who sleep?
The answer is misunderstanding.
You'd think that'd be the end of the line.
Hey, hey, hey, boy, you're not fucking with me.
Let me tell you.
I wish I wasn't here.
He's got to go in.
There was a man named Eddie Coo.
You're just a mature man.
Today, why am I so happy?
What do you want me to do for fun?
This isn't gonna happen. This is not gonna happen.
Mercy in religion
Ten is as good as fourteen.
Do you really think it's a good idea to take a look at it?
Instead of saying hello, say hello.
That's what's happening here, right now.
When he came, he said, "Janab, go over there, okay?"
I've heard about work and stuff.
Now you don't have to ask. Is there anything we can do for you?
Oh, well, does that bitch have to wait six months?
Did you do it yourself or did you know how to do it?
Are you proud of that?
You can throw the ball or burn it.
"Get out! Get out! Get out! What have you done to me?"
Yes, it is.
You know Ango is a relative of this teacher in Jamia.
Eddie Law doesn't go to the beach or the water.
Okay, then let me tell you something.
You're going to hit the Malaysian with the Kurdish.
I think he's right. He won't let it go.
I'm going to take it out into all the corners, but this is God's temple.
Then the southerners didn't understand the alphabet.
You can't get out of here unless the law and order are in place.
They're coming in.
They're haunting the dolphins through the cattle.
You like to make a lot of noise.
Do you want to go in with him?

We'll e-mail you to the house.
These are my notes.
Linga and the understanding goat
The doctor is there.
I don't have any friends. I'm going around the world.
There are flowers and flowers in it.
He knows himself, and he lies.
She's right, they're all very happy, Aunt.
This song is dedicated to God.
Son, do not fear God, but obey him.
You're blind in your eyes.
Did you know that?
My heart was troubled when I was with you, and God was troubled when he was with you.
I need your help.
How are the eggs?
He said, "Take off your glasses".
I read about them in a book.
Are you going to stop talking about this?
That's a lie!
Now Ango is your doctor.
I'm going to tell you a story.
What does he do? What does he deny?
What can you do with that name?
This is the philosopher. This is the ruler's son. This is Plato.
One of them is the street of satisfaction, and the other is the street of mality.
And I filled my mouth with clay. Is it not this I say?
It's just that it's the hard part.
We didn't give Yan's politics to war.
So, well, does the world do that?
Yes, I'm full of it!
In the evening, he stops in front of Adab's cottage.
But if you do not stop saying this, it is nonsense. I have made you a fool.
You know what, I remember you so badly.
He's got a lot to say.
So did the ancients.
I've never been there to check.
I don't want to do anything.
And peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.
Come on, I'm going to cut the slate and you're going to get your shoes dirty. Come on!
If you were an orphan, would you come here?
Here you are.

Go on, take it easy.
Transfer the material from the liquid state to the gas
I don't like being locked up.
I know what it is! I know what it is.
What have they done?
I was going to say you're fat and tall.
Are you sure?
Okay, buddy. It's not hard to find a ministry in these corridors. What's up?
I'm with you, let's go in and write him a doctor.
Why don't you call these people by my name?
So, well, did you know I'm going to Lawnmower?
If you call me by my name, I will call you by that name.
It's just that I'm busy every day.
If you want to stop doing that.
I promised to be with him. Lo called me.
I'm going to kill you if you don't.
Please do not forget the five thousand.
I pray thee, I pray thee, speak not unto me, and let me not cry.
In whose name was he born?
And all your souls will smell the oil, and we will eat it.
It was a daily affair.
This is a Kurdish jacket, Kurdish jacket!
Find out if it's written or not.
Blind under this man's umbrella, I'm going to break your legs.
I've been working on a new project.
I'm deaf and hard of hearing, Doctor.
I'll get it for you, but they're not moving here right now.
Well, which of these is the thesis on which?
They like it. It's hopeful and hopeful.
Until you know it, you can use this gold coin!
Look me in the eye.
Please don't go crazy!
Wow, this phone has made my life a living.
What's this electrical thing?
You blind man, you blind man, you blind man, you blind man, you blind man, you blind man.
There's no better way.
It's nothing but what's inside.
Is there not a lock in a lock? Do they not keep it?
No, he's not going to.
I'll be right back, but I'll put it in my diary.
They sent a handshake.
You don't eat roast meat? Roast meat is good.
You don't know what it's like to make mistakes.
Oh, my brother.
Come on. What's your town of Gotham?
He must never go back to sleep while working.
There's nothing we can do.
No, I won't.
He did it by hand.
Father, hurt him.
But it's so strange that there's a very strange information about the atom.
No, it didn't work out that way.
Go round the circle of the field.
The owner of the property is the owner.
And the orphans! The people are sitting. And the doctor came.
What doesn't he find?
In another plant, you said your sugar was low.
We'll talk about it later.
Oh! That's it. I know that, it's high cholesterol.
She doesn't remember.
There's a lot of logic in that.
It is a denial; it is a denial; nothing has ever been created by itself.
Well, honey, which one do you want?
Boy, put it down. Put it down.
Our missile? Let's have a little chair.
Are you so upset, Rahman Khan?
The street itself is now a car and its equipment is not working.
Who do you think this is?
Each of these countries did its own thing.
Do you see how smart and cool these people are?

I'm not marrying these women.
Now we're going to talk about ourselves and Jalal.
I'm so lucky to be here.
You've made my home a mess.
I'm a bear, this is my bear, and this is Ango's bear.
Ango Lo is down?
Apherin B. The body
Stop, do not step.
Take my place in your household.
They seem to have made peace.
You used to be good, you were a little stubborn.
I gave up.
Your mouth smells good, eat it.
But you can go here.
Kaki Mukherjee suggested I give him one of the main circles.
I know the smell of my son.
It's good to be back.
They said,
It's like hearing aids.
All right, Nasrin, give it a hand.
Look at his tongue!
Two or three at a time!
They're about to hit me.
You're worse than that.
You can't walk! Get down!
What is it?
A car came.
It's your home, yes.
What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this?
Do you remember the flowers?
My job is to help.
Don't do that.
Keep calm, keep calm.
Well, aren't you running for office?
What's a circle?
They're guests, what do I do with them?
I've got some work to do. He'll be right back.
Don't eat your coffee.
There is nothing left.
Who is Lo Noroz?
Abe, he doesn't drink coffee.
Look for him, honey, come on.
I've been spinning around in the mosque.
Take care of yourself
It's worth it.
The woman brought me this grapefruit.
Let me get to work.
I'm not alone anymore.
I'm going to bed.
That's it. I got to go.
I'll send him over.
They've gone to neighborhood fights, they've run away and they've come.
Don't worry, honey, give me some coffee.
God bless you.
Over the eyes.
Come on in and get the sweet stuff.
It's the way you thought it would be.
Talk together
Eddie, do you want to quit or not?
On the other hand, they're children.
I'm going to call it Eddie.
A woman becomes angry. A woman becomes weak. A man becomes angry.
Don't be afraid. I'm not going to the city tonight.
The blind man searches for him. What do you have to do?
Everybody comes in, that's my list. Give it up.
A hundred people want to make a wish.
I'm so overwhelmed, I'm so lost.
What are the giants?
The other guy's got a broken glass.
Let us not be ashamed of people.
You'll have to go get some money.
Make a low-key call.
Let us smuggle and get away with what God has done for us.
This is how your house should be! You have ruined me.
Is that what you're getting at?
Are we allowed in?
The blind come and they don't eat. They don't stop for a while.
Do not weep. God is great.
How many numbers do I have?
I've had them bleed twice a day.
I'm an orphan, and I'm asking you not to do anything good.
They made fun of him when he came back.
There are some policies that don't make you angry.
"Then what are these things that you do not conceal from your father?
So how do I understand you now?
They don't have electric missiles.
I've won a great prize.
When I got there, I was safe.
I'm here to steal so I don't see anyone.
